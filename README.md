## Mini R Programs

This repo is a collection of useful scripts in R that I had made during my time at the Banaras Hindu University. This repo is not meant to be a complete R library but rather a collection of scripts for more minor works from Scratch.

## About Me

I am a Research Scholar at the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, in the 
Department of Mathematics, earlier I had pursued my Masters in Statistics and 
Computing at Banaras Hindu University at the Centre for Interdisciplinary 
Mathematical Sciences (CIMS). Currently, my research is focused on the 
Statistical Machine Learning and its applications.  

:warning: I am looking for collaborators specifically for writing a Probabilistic 
Programming Language using JAX. If you are interested in this, don't hesitate to get in touch with me.
